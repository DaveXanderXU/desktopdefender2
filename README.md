## Backstory

Our galaxy, the Milky Way, was always full of life. Life thrives everywhere and humans are just a minor part of Earth's history. 4 million years ago the Zonerians from Sirius, threatened by destruction, settled on our homeworld. Far from the center of the galaxy, the Earth made a perfect new home for them. The Zonerians built many settlements deep underground our planet and the Moon. Following the laws of nature they decided not to interfere with Earth's life beings. They never took part neither in man's wars nor in their world crises and suffering. Their socially and technologically far superior society was merely a silent observer.

The ultimate force in our galaxy is the Galactic confederation. Most intelligent species, who managed to reach the point of space travel, take part in it. However, every great force has a enemy. The Black League, one of the most powerful coalitions in our galaxy, is the only force capable of resisting the confederation. Monitoring the fast progress of the human race, the confederation decided to take a major step towards making Earth's human beings a part of the alliance. The Black League, however, claimed to have legal rights over the Solar System and it's resources. The first step towards a galactic war was more than clear. Securing Sols resources and the rich of life and water planet, the Earth, was their primary goal. Having it's major forces too far away to prevent the invasion, the Galactic confederation was helpless to stop the Black League. Only the joint forces of humans and Zonerians stood between life and destruction.
