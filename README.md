## Backstory

The Milky Way was always full of life. Life thrives everywhere and humans are just a minor part of Earth's history. 4 million years ago the Zonerians from Sirius, threatened by destruction, settled on our homeworld. Far from the center of the galaxy the Earth made a perfect new home for them. The Zonerians built many settlements deep underground the planet and the Moon. Following the laws of nature they decided not to interfere with Earth's evolution. They took part neither in man's wars nor in their world crises and suffering. Their socially and technologically far superior society was merely a silent observer.

The ultimate force in our galaxy is the Galactic Confederation. Most intelligent species, who managed to reach the point of space travel, are members of it. However, every great force has a great enemy. The Black League, one of the most powerful coalitions in our galaxy, is the only force capable of resisting the Confederation. After monitoring the evolution of the human species for ages, the Confederation decided to take a major step towards making Earth's human beings a part of the alliance. The Black League, however, claimed to have legal rights over the Sol and it's resources. The first step towards a galactic war was then more than clear. Securing the Sol's resources and the abundant of life planet - the Earth, was their primary goal. Having it's major forces too far away to prevent an invasion, the Galactic Confederation is helpless to stop the Black League. Only the joint human and zonerian forces stand between the Earth's total destruction.
